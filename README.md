# Ms Veitch's Classroom Library

This repository contains the code for our ICS4U (Computer Science) Summative Project, completed in June 2024 with [Jessica Tao](https://github.com/jetao7).

Ms. Veitch’s Classroom Library is a web app that displays all of Ms. Veitch’s books, allowing her students to browse her collection and borrow books that they are interested in. It is hosted through Google Apps Script (JavaScript, HMTL, CSS) so she can easily add new books to the Google Sheet database. The search bar, filtering, and sorting functions give students the ability to easily customize the books being displayed so that they can find the books that they are interested in.

The [Software Block Diagram](software-block-diagram.png) provides an overview of the website structure.
